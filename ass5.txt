1)
A skiplist with p = 1/2, that contains n elements will give us:

L = log (based 1/p) N elements.

Since p = 1/2, (1/(1/2))is 2.

L = log (based 2) N elements.
Expected number of levels is Lg(n).

2)
The levels of the nodes in a skip list is not uniformly distributed between 1 and its height H.
The probability that a node will have height h = 1/H is:

Depending on what H is.

From level 1, the chance a node gets promoted is 1/2.
From level 2, the chance a node gets promoted again ist a 1/2.
From level 3, the chance a node gets promoted again ist a 1/2.

So for level 2:  the chance is 1/2.
For level 3:     the chance is 1/4.
For level 4:     the chance is 1/8.

The probability is 1 / (2^h-1), provided that the levels start counting at 1, where h is the desired height.

3)
The points that will be followed for the Search(S, 50) call is:

Head pointer at level 4 checks if the pointer's next at level 4 is null or equal to 50.  It is null. Go down a level.
Head pointer at level 3 checks if the pointer's next at level 3 is null or equal to 50.  19 is < 50.  Keep going.
19 at level 3 checks if the pointer's next at level 3 is null or equal to 50.  32 is < 50.  Keep going.
32 at level 3 checks if the pointer's next at level 3 is null or equal to 50.  71 is > 50.  Go down a level.
32 at level 2 checks if the pointer's next at level 2 is null or equal to 50.  33 is < 50.  Keep going.
33 at level 2 checks if the pointer's next at level 2 is null or equal to 50.  54 is > 50.  Go down a level.
33 at level 1 checks if the pointer's next at level 1 is null or equal to 50.  36 is < 50.  Keep going.
36 at level 1 checks if the pointer's next at level 1 is null or equal to 50.  40 is < 50.  Keep going.
40 at level 1 checks if the pointer's next at level 1 is null or equal to 50.  It is equal to 50.  We found it.
